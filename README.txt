This is the Assignment 1: Word Search project for CS& 145 at Whatcom Community College.
The goal of this project is to have a user input some words. The program will arrange them into
a word search to be printed. This can be printed as a completed word search or a answer sheet.
A nxn 2d array will be used for the word search and an array list for storing the input words.
